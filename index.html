                    <hr class="light">
                    <h4>Early Life</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">I was born in Bend, Oregon and grew up with an appreciation for all things outdoors. As a kid, I wanted to be a lawyer, a chef, an interpreter, or a businesswoman. When I started studying at the University of Oregon, I was a Mathematics major with no idea what I actually wanted to do. I joined Rugby, took every elective I could, but at the end of my freshman year I took my first Computer Science course. I was hooked. I switched to a Math and Computer Science major before the next school year had started.
                    </p>
                    <h4>University</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">June 2017, I will graduate with a Bachelor's degree. I have taken courses in C/C++, Java, Python, HTML, and PHP. There has always been a focus on not just writing code, but writing smart, easy to read code. I've become well-versed in object oriented and functional programming as well as Database Architecture. My math background and many data structures courses have built my ability to create intelligent and informed database designs and sorting applications. Due to their mathematical nature, Data structures courses have always absorbed my attention. I have worked on countless group projects that showed me how to read and integrate others' code.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">Over the last three years, I have participated in all of the University's hackathons in which I discovered that I'm an excellent project lead. I also joined the Web Dev club and was president of the Women in Computer Science (WiCS) club. And in that time I've discovered as much about myself as I have Computer Science. I'm not the fastest worker, but I'm always the hardest worker. I'm an efficient leader, who quadrupled participation as president of WiCS. When working on a hard project I do best collaborating in person with a colleague.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Work History</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">When not in class, I work part time at an IT help desk for the Architecture and Allied Arts school of the University of Oregon. I've learned a lot about the common issues with software on the user side as well as how to manage my time and keep myself busy even when it's slow. I have also waited tables every summer at the Sunriver Brewing Co. To work in such a fast paced environment, I had to be able to organize and prioritize requests, orders, and my thoughts in general. I had to take the initiative in order to work my way from hostess to server. I managed to maintain friendships with most of my coworkers, because I knew when to be assertive and when to back down. I have excelled at both jobs because I have great collaborative skills, I'm very well organized, and I'm great at leading by example.
